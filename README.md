G-Ducky is a USB HID device based on the Arduino Pro Micro, designed to execute pre-defined scripts from an SD card, simulating keystrokes to automate tasks. The device features an OLED display for user interaction, allowing selection and execution of scripts stored on the SD card.

## üéØ Features

- **USB HID Automation:** Executes DuckyScript-like commands stored in text files on an SD card.
- **OLED Display Menu:** Navigate through scripts stored on the SD card using an intuitive menu system.
- **Three-Button Control:** Easily navigate the menu, select scripts, and initiate execution with three buttons.
- **Script Feedback:** Displays the current script execution progress on the OLED screen.
